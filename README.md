# Cardiovascular Risk Model Transportability Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project focused on evaluating the transportability of a cardiovascular risk model. The model, originally developed using data from the Framingham Heart Study, is applied to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to assess the effectiveness and adaptability of a cardiovascular risk prediction model across different populations. This involves comparing the model's performance when applied to the NHANES dataset versus its performance on the original Framingham dataset.

## Repository Structure

`report3.rmd`

`cite.bib`

`report3.pdf`: Comprehensive report of the study's findings, including methodology, results, and discussion.

## Key Components

**Data Processing**: Scripts for preparing and cleaning the Framingham and NHANES datasets for analysis.

**Model Building**: Code for developing the cardiovascular risk prediction model.

**Simulation Study**: Implementation of various simulation scenarios to assess model transportability.

**Statistical Analysis**: Scripts for computing Brier scores and other relevant metrics.
Visualization: Code for generating plots and figures to illustrate key findings.


## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

+ Clone the repository to your local machine.
+ Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed.
+ Run the scripts in the src/ directory in the order specified in the project documentation.

## Dependencies
R (version x.x.x or higher)
R packages: dplyr, ggplot2, MASS, tableone, etc.
